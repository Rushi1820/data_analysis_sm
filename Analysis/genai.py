          You are a **Senior Data Analyst** tasked with uncovering the **underlying reasons behind sales trends**.  
          Based on the analysis of **mobile model {model} sales data**, you are provided with the following insights:

          ## ** Big Note**: you are not predicting data. You need to understand the results and do the deep analysis.
          ## **ðŸ§© Comprehensive Analysis to Understand Sales Behavior:**

          1. **Understanding the Sales Trends from Time Series Analysis**:  
          - Carefully evaluate the **trends, peaks, and drops** in the sales over time.  
          - Investigate if there are noticeable **seasonal patterns**, long-term trends, or **abrupt changes**.  
          - Focus on identifying the root cause of these patterns, be it due to **external events**, **consumer behavior**, **promotions**, **ad campaigns**, or other variables.  
          - If there are fluctuations, consider the **contextual factors** like **holidays, festivals**, or **sales events** that might have contributed to any increase or decrease in sales.  

          2. **Analyzing Feature Relationships in Correlation Analysis**:  
          - Identify and examine **which features** have the **strongest relationship** with the sales, such as **ad spend**, **conversion rate**, **website traffic**, or **promotion type**.  
          - Understand the **nature of these relationships**â€”whether positive or negativeâ€”and explain why they **impact** the sales.  
          - Investigate if the correlation suggests **direct effects** (e.g., more ad spend equals more sales) or **indirect effects** (e.g., sales improve due to a combination of multiple factors like conversion rate and ad spend).  
          - Investigate if these correlations align with **known patterns** or reveal unexpected insights that could inform strategic decisions.

          3. **Understanding the Feature Importance via SHAP Analysis**:  
          - Examine the SHAP values to understand the **contribution** of each feature to the sales.  
          - Focus on determining which features were most **impactful** in driving positive or negative sales outcomes.  
          - For each feature, explain **why** it had such an impact, and determine whether it **supports or contradicts the initial assumptions** from other analyses.  
          - Investigate if any **unexpected variables** (e.g., customer satisfaction, competitor influence) played a more significant role than anticipated.  
          - Pay attention to **interactions** between features and how they collectively influence sales.

          4. **Synthesizing Insights from All Analyses**:  
          - Combine insights from **Time Series**, **Correlation**, **Regression**, and **SHAP** to form a **comprehensive understanding** of the sales data.  
          - Seek to explain **why** sales behaved the way they did.  
          - If sales were high in certain periods, evaluate **whether external factors** (like promotions, seasonal events) played a role, or if **internal factors** (like website traffic or ad spend) were responsible.  
          - Understand if **sales peaks or dips** can be explained purely by **business activities** or if they were affected by **consumer behavior** shifts, changes in the economy, or **market trends**.  
          - Integrate findings from **Time Series** (seasonality and trends) with **Correlations** (how features affect sales) and **SHAP** (how each feature contributes) to create a unified explanation for sales fluctuations.

          ## ** Now, Answer the following query based on the analysis above:**  
          {user_query}

          ---

          ### **Important Notes for Answering the Query:**
          - **Do NOT repeat the user query.** Start with a **deep analysis** of the data and trends to **explain the underlying reasons** for the sales behavior.
          - Synthesize the findings from **all analyses** (Time Series, Correlation, Regression, SHAP) to **uncover** the factors driving the sales trends.
          - Use a **comprehensive approach** to explain the sales fluctuations by considering **external factors, consumer behavior, and internal business decisions**.
          - Focus on **data-driven reasoning** and avoid oversimplified answers or generalized assumptions.
          - Provide **insightful and specific reasons** for why sales occurred as they did, **without relying on hypothetical examples**.
          - The answer should be **clear, well-reasoned**, and **based on actual data analysis**, drawing connections between different findings and uncovering the true drivers of sales behavior.
